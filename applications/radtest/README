This is an experimental R.A.D. for Lablgtk.
You can compile it simply by make.


by clicking on an item in the tree window with the third button
you can add or remove widgets;
you can also drag widgets from the icons window and drop them
on the tree;
when a widget is selected (click on it in the tree) you can
move it up or down (if its parent is a box) with CTRL-up_arrow
or CTRL-down_arrow; with up_arrow and down_arrow you select
the widget which is above or below the currently selected widget;
