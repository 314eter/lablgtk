	A GUI for Unison

Here is a lablGTK port of Unison's GUI.
Or rather was, since this is now the standard GUI for unison.

Unison is a file synchronization software developped by Benjamin
Pierce, Trevor Jim, and others.

As of version 2.2.35, unison is based on LablGTK 1.00.
To use it with the current version, you must:
 * get unison-2.2.35/src.tar.gz from http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/
 * untar it in this directory
 * copy or make links for uigtk.ml here inside unison-2.2.35
        ln -fs ../uigtk.ml .
 * make and follow instructions in INSTALL.txt
