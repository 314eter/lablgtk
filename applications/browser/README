	Browser: the beginning of a port of the LablBrowser

Installation:

* make a link from a directory where the O'Labl distribution is
  compiled to olabl-src
	ln -s /path/to/olabl/ocaml-2.02 olabl-src
  (actually only the directory parsing needs to be compiled)

* just type "make"

Use:

When you run browser, you just get a customized editor with lexical
coloring. Nothing very fancy.
In the file menu you can open a shell, running olabl as subprocess.
