This is a very early release of lablgtk, and we have not yet fixed the
definitive copying policy (probably a combination of BSD and/or
GPL/LGPL).  To preserve our ability to choose later, the following two
conditions apply to this code.

* You are free to do anything you want with this code as long as it is
  for personal use.

* Redistribution can only be "as is".  Binary distribution and bug
  fixes are allowed (cf. exceptions lower), but you cannot extensively
  modify the code without asking the authors.

The authors may choose to remove any of the above restrictions on a
per request basis.

Exceptions:
* you cannot redistribute binary version of the toplevel, due to the
  Objective Caml copying policy.  Please read Objective Caml COPYING
  before doing any binary distribution.
* applications/radtest/gtktree2.c and gtktree2.h are patched version
  of Gtk original files.  As such they follow LGPL copying guidelines.
* applications/lablglade is a derivative of glade, and is released
  under GPL.
