* Gio-2.0.gir:

specifies additional included, but provides absolute path for them.
Is it portable ?

* Atk-1.0.gir:

extract_stubs produces a ATK_G_OBJECT_ACCESSIBLE id, not found in Atk-1.0.gir:
#define AtkGObjectAccessible_val(val) check_cast(ATK_G_OBJECT_ACCESSIBLE,val)

* Glib-2.0.gir:

manque d'info sur les paramètres de g_iconv_close => warning de cast à la compil

* GLib:

How to handle locale now ?

* GtkObject is gone
 and GtkWidget must be used instead.
 I renamed gtkObject.ml to gtkWidget.ml.
 In the stub generator, GtkObject.make was used to create objects, even
 in the GLib stubs. Now GtkWidget.make is used instead, but I wonder
 if this is the right way to go.
