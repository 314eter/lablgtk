             LablGTK2 2.18.0 : an interface to the GIMP Tool Kit

Needed:
        ocaml-3.11 or more (4.01 is preferred)
        gtk+-2.x (gtk+-2.16 or more for full functionality)
        findlib 1.2.1 or more (for default install)
        GNU make (there is no standard for conditionals in makefiles)

How to compile:

  In case you are using the SVN version you may have to first type
  "autoreconf -fiv".

  Type
        ./configure && make world
  to compile with all supported options enabled (libgl, libglade,
  libgnomecanvas, librsvg, native compilation, thread support).

  You may use "./configure --help" to check for the different
  configuration options.

  Lablgtk2 specific options are:

        --with-libdir=/path: install libs in /path/lablgtk2
                             and /path/stublibs
        --with-gl --without-gl: override autodetected GtkGLArea support.
                                Requires LablGL
        --with-glade --without-glade: override autodetected libglade support
        --with-rsvg --without-rsvg: override autodetected librsvg support
        --with-gnomecanvas --without-gnomecanvas:
                override autodetected libgnomecanvas support
        --with-gnomeui --without-gnomeui:
                override autodetected libgnomeui support
        --with-panel --without-panel:
                override autodetected libpanelapplet support
        --with-gtkspell --without-gtkspell:
                override autodetected gtkspell support
        --with-gtksourceview --without-gtksourceview:
                override autodetected gtksourceview support
        --with-gtksourceview2 --without-gtksourceview2:
                override autodetected gtksourceview2 support
        --enable-debug: enable debug mode

  Type "make install" to install using findlib.
  The commands lablgtk2, gdk_pixbuf_mlsource, and lablgladecc2,
  are copied directly to the configured executable directory.

  The following findlib packages are provided (according to configuration):

        lablgtk2
        lablgtk2.auto-init # Meant for toplevels
        lablgtk2.gl
        lablgtk2.glade
        lablgtk2.gnomecanvas
        lablgtk2.gnomehtml
        lablgtk2.gnomeui
        lablgtk2.gtkspell
        lablgtk2.panel
        lablgtk2.rsvg
        lablgtk2.sourceview
        lablgtk2.sourceview2

  You can alternatively use "make old-install" or
  "make old-install DESTDIR=/my/prefix" to use the old
  installation procedure, which does not rely on findlib.
  By default, the library is installed at +lablgtk2.
  All installation paths are prefixed by DESTDIR when given.
