Synopsis

	Why GTK+?
%size 2

	GTK+ structure
%size 2

	Low Level
		Variant types in interfaces
		Labeled parameters
%size 2

	High Level
		Object-orientation
		Optional arguments
		Polymorphic methods
%size 2

	Conclusion

Why GTK+ ?

Why use the GIMP Tool Kit?
%size 3

	Widely used in free software

	Easy to interface
		Written in C (QT uses C++)
		Memory management

Drawbacks
%size 3

	Design lacks uniformity
	Extensive use of dynamic typing

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

GTK+ Structure

Class hierarchy based on GtkObject
%size 2

	Single inheritance
&com1 New widgets may redefine methods
%size 2

	Dynamically checked
&com1 Casting necessay both up and down
%size 2

	Developper-side hierarchy
&com1 Inheritance is not always meaningful to the user
%size 2

%size 5
Signal-based callback mechanism
%size 2

	May use multiple callbacks
%size 2

	Signals are polymorphic

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Low Level Interface

Goals

	Strongly typed interface
&com1 heavy use of advanced typing techniques

	Very little ML code
&com1 C-stubs and external declarations

	Safe memory management
&com1 have the library cooperate with the GC

Low level encoding (I)

Example: buttons' hierarchy

GtkObject
    GtkWidget
        GtkContainer
            GtkButton
                GtkToggleButton
                    GtkRadioButton

&txt In ML
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, prefix "    ", fore "yellow"
type 'a obj
type widget = [widget] obj
type container = [widget container] obj
type button = [widget container button] obj
type toggle_button = [widget ... togglebutton] obj
type radio_button = [widget ... radiobutton] obj

Variants as set constraints


Variants can be seen as sets of possible values:

	[tag1 ... tagn] = {tag1,...,tagn}


Polymorphic variants introduce constraints

	α[> tag1 ... tagn] ⇔ α ⊃ {tag1,...,tagn}
	α[< tag1 ... tagn] ⇔ α ⊂ {tag1,...,tagn}

Encoding subtyping hierarchies

Define an abstract type
&vspace
%font "code", fore "yellow", size 5
      type 'a obj

&txt Use tags to represent properties
&vspace
%font "code", fore "yellow", size 5
      type t = [class1 ... classn] obj

&txt Functions check properties
&vspace
%font "code", fore "yellow", size 5
      val f : [> class1 ... classn] obj -> ...
&txt
	Subsumes Haskell type classes
&vspace
	Allows multiple inheritance

Some functions
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, prefix "  ", fore "yellow", vgap 50
type state_type = [ NORMAL
     ACTIVE PRELIGHT SELECTED INSENSITIVE ] 
val set_state : [> widget] obj -> state_type -> unit
val children : [> container] obj -> [widget] obj list
val clicked : [> button] obj -> unit
val set_group : [> radiobutton] obj -> group -> unit

&txt Signals
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, prefix "  ", fore "yellow", vgap 50
type ('a,'b) signal =
    { name: string; marshaller: 'b -> GtkArgv.t -> unit }
val connect : 'a obj -> sig:('a,'b) signal ->
               callback:'b -> ?after:bool -> id
val button_clicked : ([> button], unit -> unit) signal

High-Level Interface

Problems with GTK+
%size 2

	Name space is scattered
&com1 One has to know in which superclass a function is defined
	Developper oriented design
&com1 There is no clear distinction between public and private definitions

&txt LablGTK design
%size 2

	OCaml classes to reunify name space
	Omit developper-oriented methods

High-level classes

%font "code", size 4, prefix "  ", fore "yellow", vgap 50
class button :
%fore "lightgreen"
  ?label:string ->
%fore "lightblue"
  ?border_width:int ->
  ?width:int ->
  ?height:int ->

High-level features


	Objective Caml classes
&com1 allow collecting methods from different modules

	Use optionals in class constructors
&com1 makes widget creation much easier

	Polymorphic methods
&com1 needed for container widgets
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, fore "yellow", vgap 50
        method add : 'a. (#is_widget as 'a) -> unit
&txt
	Polymorphic variants
&com1 for C-style enumeration types, avoid name-space dependancies

Polymorphic methods (I)

	Instance of first-class polymorphism
%size 2

		first-class polytypes cannot be inferred
		they are propagated by the definition flow

	Technically
%size 2

		use polymorphism to track available information
		type system excludes derivations based on "guessed" information

type #is_widget = < as_widget : widget obj; .. >
type container =
    < ... ; add : 'a. (#as_widget as 'a) -> unit; ... >

Conclusion

	Results
%size 2

		Could build a strongly typed interface

		It is easier to use than the C API

		Makes effective use of extensions to the type system

	Comments
%size 2

		Still difficulties sith the Caml object system
