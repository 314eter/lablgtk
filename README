		LablGTK : an interface to the GIMP Tool Kit


Needed:
	olabl-2.00
	gtk-1.0.x
	gmake (standard make may work with a twist)

How to compile:

	Just type "make".
	If anything changed, type "make configure; make".

Contents:

	gdk.ml		low-level interface to the General Drawing Kit
	gtk.ml		low-level interface to the GIMP Tool Kit
	gtkThread.ml	main loop for threaded version
	gtkObj.ml	object-oriented interface to GTK

	lablgtk		normal toplevel
	lablgtk_t	threaded toplevel

	examples/*.ml		various examples
	examples/*_obj.ml	examples based on GtkObj

How to run the examples:

	./lablgtk examples/???.ml

  some examples may need to be run from the examples directory

	../lablgtk -I .. ???.ml

How to use the threaded toplevel:

	% ./lablgtk_t
	        Objective Caml version 2.00 with Kyoto labels and variants
	
	# let id = Thread.create GtkThread.main ();;
	val id : Thread.t = <abstr>

  The GTK main loop is now running in a separate thread. Any command
  is immediately reflected by the system.
  Beware that you cannot switch threads within a callback, that is the
  only thread related command you may use in a callback is
  Thread.create. On the other hand, all newly created threads will be
  run directly by the caml main loop, so they can use all thread
  operations.
