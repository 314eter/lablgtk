This is a library of modules for the functional programming language
Objective Caml (http://caml.inria.fr) . It provides:

PC.ML             
-----
    
Parser combinators.  Parsers can be build from primitive parsers
provided by this module.  Perfect for small parsing issues like
command line arguments.

PC2.ML
------

This is a similar implementation of parser combinators but uses
different sequence and semantic action operators. 
 
PP.ML	      	
-----
    
Pretty printing.  Structured documents are build up from primtive
ones.  These documents then can be pretty printed for different line
length to strings or files.  The approach follows Philip Wadlers
proposed pretty printer algebra.  However, it features some small
additions and is redesigned for strict implementations.

LC.ML
-----
 
Lexer combinators for string scanning.  Inspired by the idea of parser
combinators but especially suited for strings.

STD.ML	
------

Generic functions which I feel are missing in the OCaml Standard
library. 
 
		
BUILDING
--------

Simply typing 'make' should work. See the Makefile for additional
targets.
