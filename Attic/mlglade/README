mlglade is a tool to translate a glade xml file into a set of modules for 
OCaml >= 3.01.

BUILDING
--------

Compiling mlglade requires OCaml 3.01 or above. 	
Simply typing 'make' should work. 
There is no 'install' target. The executable 'mlglade' is standalone
therefore you can simply copy it somewhere in your
$PATH. Sorry, no man page yet.

INVOKING MLGLADE
----------------

`mlglade project.glade' reads project.glade and creates the files :
- project_glade_main.ml
- project_glade_callbacks.ml
- project_glade_interface.ml
- makefile

You can safely modify project_glade_main.ml and makefile, they will never be
overwritten by mlglade.


LIMITATIONS
-----------
Only a subset of the widgets are recognized at this time:

-GtkButton (no stock buttons)
-GtkCheckb
-GtkCombo (no method connect available in GEdit.combo : lablgtk pb ???)
-GtkDrawingArea
-GtkEntry
-GtkFileSelection (you cannot change the labels of the buttons inside glade)
-GtkHBox
-GtkHButtonBox
-GtkHPaned
-GtkHSeparator
-GtkHandleBox
-GtkLabel
-GtkList
-GtkMenu
-GtkMenuBar
-GtkMenuItem
-GtkNoteBook
-GtkOptionMenu (you cannot fill it from glade right now)
-GtkPixmap
-GtkScrolledWindow
-GtkStatusBar
-GtkTable
-GtkText (TODO unknown events copy_clipboard, cut_clipboard, kill_char
	kill_line, kill_word, move_cursor, move_page, move_to_column
	move_to_row, paste_clipboard, set_editable. labgtk pb ?)
-GtkToolbar (not the 2 specific events because of lablgtk)
-GtkToggleButton
-GtkTree
-GtkVBox
-GtkVButtonBox
-GtkVPaned
-GtkVSeparator
-GtkViewPort
-GtkWindow

Tooltips are supported for all widgets.

Note that mlglade may produce non compilable ocaml code 
when you use some features that seem available in glade but 
are in fact non existent in Gtk. For example you should not try to 
use Xevents with windowless widgets or you will get something like:
"This expression has type GMisc.label
It has no method event".


Accelerators are supported.

Event fields are not supported.

Data and Object fields of signals are not supported. They are deprecated 
in glade anyway.


If you encounter any problem with these widgets please report it to
Benjamin.Monate@lri.fr.

BUGS
----

Here is a list of what I would name a bug:

-The autogenerated code does not compile AND what you want to do is allowed 
by Gtk.
-Some properties you chose in glade are not present in the ml program
-Your custom callbacks are not called properly

Here is a list of what I would name a feature wish:

-An unimplemented message
-An umimplemented widget
-Another architecture for the generated modules

In any case I would be grateful if you could send me:
-a minimal .glade example
-your version of glade
-your version of gtk
-your version of lablgtk
-your version of ocaml
